## First Verse 
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Lewis Carrol in this section!-->
How doth the little crocodile   
     Improve his shining tail,   
And pour the waters of the Nile   
     On every golden scale!   
    
How cheerfully he seems to grin,

## Last Verse
<!--Put a short poem of your choice 8-20 lines,here!-->
My long two-pointed ladder's sticking through a tree  
Toward heaven still,  
And there's a barrel that I didn't fill  
Beside it, and there may be two or three  
Apples I didn't pick upon some bough.  
But I am done with apple-picking now.  
Essence of winter sleep is on the night,  
The scent of apples: I am drowsing off.  
I cannot rub the strangeness from my sight  
I got from looking through a pane of glass  
I skimmed this morning from the drinking trough  
And held against the world of hoary grass.  
It melted, and I let it fall and break.  
But I was well
